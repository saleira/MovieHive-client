## Testing the Project with Parcel

Follow these steps to test the project locally:

1. **Install Parcel (if not already installed):**  
   Ensure you have [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) installed globally. You can install it using the following command:  
   ```bash
   npm install -g parcel-bundler

2. **Run the Development Server:**
    Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and start the server using Parcel. Replace [path/to/index.html] with the actual relative path to your [index.html] file:
    ```bash
    parcel [path/to/index.html]

    For example, if your [index.html] file is in the project root folder, you can run:
    ```bash
    parcel ./index.html

3. **Open the App in Your Browser:**
    Once the Parcel server starts, it will typically serve the app at [http://localhost:1234]. Open this link in your browser to view and test the project.

4. **Stop the Server (Optional):**
    To stop the Parcel server, press [Ctrl + C] in the terminal.
